# About Me

## My name is Dorion Massengill

I am a first year student at Mizzou and proud to be a tiger!

I am majoring in IT because nothing is as exciting to me as the progress and innovation of technology and I want nothing more than to be able to push the limits of technology as we know them to create an exciting and beautiful future.
